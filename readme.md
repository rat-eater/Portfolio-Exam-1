Task A Explanation:

For the code to be concise I used explicit loops and manual checks to process each argument. The multiply function calculates the result of multiple inputs while handling edge cases. In short, I used "...args" to accept any number or arguments, then converting inputs to numbers and validating them, returning to "NaN" if any argument is invalid. After that, I used a loop starting with an initial product of 1 to multiply the valid numbers, returning the product after processing all arguments.

Task B Explanation:
I used the "formatName" function to create a string that ensures the capitalization, while handling the edge cases. The code validates input, returning null if the input is not a string or if it contains special characters. It trims the whitespaces and handles empty strings if the trimmed output is empty.

Task C Explanation:
Based on the Fibonacci sequence, I implemented a function that checks any invalid inputs. In case any of the conditions fail, the function returns to null. I set the base cases and started with the two first Fibonacci numbers (a = 0 and b = 1), then used a loop to calculate the numbers up to n. After the loop is complete, it returns the value of , which holds the Fibonacci number at position n.

Task D Explanation:
For this code, I implemented a function that checks if "target" and "guess" are both numbers and integers. It returns null for non-integer numbers, strings, NaN, null and/or undefined. It has comparison logic (returns every result as needed) and handles edge cases (it handles zero, negative numbers correctly and ensures invalid inputs are rejected).
